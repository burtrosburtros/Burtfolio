        <p id="blog-body-first">If you don't like a ginormous, 50 foot, half naked, tattered diaper wearing man wreaking havoc on the US Army in downtown Las Vegas then you don't like B-Movies my friend! The latest project at <a>AB Design Co</a> is a poster book commemorating the most ridiculous B-Movies of all time.</p>

        <p id="blg-bdy-img-cap">These crabs are making me thirsty</p>
        
        <p id="blog-body">We've all flipped past a grotesque irradiated alien insect horde obliterating the people of earth at 3 a.m. while searching for something, <i>anything</i>, to watch. This book is for the people who choose to say, "What the fuuu..." And switch back to that channel. Those of us who take absolute joy in the camp and melodrama of mind-controlled crabs descending on the white house to kidnap the president.</p>
        
        <p id="blog-body">Each flub filled featured film will be watched in its absolute entirety and analyzed to such a painstaking degree that the shear mass of B-movie knowledge gained from reading this book will make your mutated, self-actualizing, flying brain crap its pants. Every page will be ripe with quips from the movie, critical lambasting by the best in the business and conversely, unabashed praise from the lost souls of the internet!</p>

        <p id="blog-img-cap">Don't get it twisted, these movies were chosen based <a>SOLELY</a> on their posters</p>
        
        <p id="blog-body">... but wait, there's more! Alternate posters from far-away lands! Dark secrets embroiled in mystery surrounding the cast and crew revealed! Oh and pop up facts! Tons of <a>POP UP FACTS!</a> Soon you'll be wooing friends and family with random tidbits about movies they've never even heard of and honestly refuse to believe exist.</p>
        
        <p id="blog-body">This project is truly a labour of love as these films are far from stellar. By their very definition, B-movies are not celebrated for their amazing cinematography. Or their brilliant performances and cohesive plots. Nope, we're in it for the shlock. For the R-rated, unadulterated, blood splattered, ooze spewing shlock. And it's coming in spades!</p>
